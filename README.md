# Dahisin.com - AI-Driven & Standard HTML Learning Platforms

> Dahisin.com is an active and completed project dedicated to cognitive training and intellectual development. To serve different user needs, the platform is offered in two distinct, powerful versions: a dynamic, AI-Driven version and a universally accessible Standard HTML version.

## Platform Versions

`Dahisin.com` provides two specialized versions to deliver the best possible experience for different use cases:

### 1. AI-Driven Version
This is the advanced, dynamic version of the platform. It leverages a PHP backend and custom AI algorithms to offer a deeply personalized and adaptive learning journey.

## The "Hardcore HTML" Philosophy

The standard version of `Dahisin.com` was intentionally built using pure HTML5 without reliance on complex frontend frameworks. This decision was made for several key reasons:

* **Peak Performance & Speed:** By avoiding heavy JavaScript libraries and framework overhead, pages load almost instantly, providing a seamless and frustration-free user experience.
* **Universal Accessibility:** Pure HTML5 is universally supported. This guarantees that the content is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their device, browser, or internet connection speed.
* **Stability & Longevity:** A "hardcore HTML" approach creates a highly stable and future-proof platform. It has no external dependencies that could break or become outdated, ensuring the content remains available and functional for years to come.
* **Focus on Content:** This approach puts the focus squarely on the high-quality, human-curated content, presenting it in a clear, direct, and reliable manner.

## Technologies Used

The two versions of the platform utilize different technology stacks tailored to their specific goals:

* **AI-Driven Version:**
    * **Backend:** Vanilla PHP
    * **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
    * **AI & Machine Learning:** Custom algorithms for personalization.
    * **Frontend:** Bootstrap, jQuery, Chart.js for a dynamic UI.

* **Standard HTML Version:**
    * **Core:** Pure HTML5 and CSS3
    * **A robust, framework-free architecture focused on content delivery.**
